# boids
I have been interested in the field known as Artificial Life for a number of years. 
One of the most beautiful findings of this field is a very simple algorithm known as boids, 
which models flocking behaviour in nature. This algorithm was invented by computer animator Craig Reynolds. 

**The idea of this project comes from http://www.kfish.org/boids/**

It models flocking behaviour through serveral languages.

The rule is simply based on:
1. Boids try to fly towards the centre of mass of neighbouring boids. 
2. Boids try to keep a small distance away from other objects (including other boids). 
3. Boids try to match velocity with near boids. 

May be I will add some other factors, such as seeking food or avoiding obstacle.
